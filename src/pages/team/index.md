text: We help companies see different ways of cooperating, of sharing information on optimizing business processes. We make the supply chain fairer,      more resilient and efficient. We do this by reducing costs, throughput time, by increasing traceability and transparency within the supply          chain. We do this for the agri-food sector as it can be most helped by this technology. We are the Fork and we implement blockchain solutions.

      The Fork, founded by Marieke de Ruyter de Wildt, is the company that is on the frontier of blockchain technology.

      Blockchain technology is often equated to cryptocurrencies, but it is so much more. Blockchain can drastically boost efficiency and transparency in any food supply chain. Our blockchain solutions help supply chain professionals to quickly understand the potential of this technology for their companies.

### Shade-grown coffee
Coffee is a small tree or shrub that grows in the forest understory in its wild form, and traditionally was grown commercially under other trees that provided shade. The forest-like structure of shade coffee farms provides habitat for a great number of migratory and resident species.

### Single origin
Single-origin coffee is coffee grown within a single known geographic origin. Sometimes, this is a single farm or a specific collection of beans from a single country. The name of the coffee is then usually the place it was grown to whatever degree available.

### Sustainable farming
Sustainable agriculture is farming in sustainable ways based on an understanding of ecosystem services, the study of relationships between organisms and their environment. What grows where and how it is grown are a matter of choice and careful consideration for nature and communities.

### Direct sourcing
Direct trade is a form of sourcing practiced by some coffee roasters. Advocates of direct trade practices promote direct communication and price negotiation between buyer and farmer, along with systems that encourage and incentivize quality.

### Reinvest profits
We want to truly empower the communities that bring amazing coffee to you. Thatâs why we reinvest 20% of our profits into farms, local businesses and schools everywhere our coffee is grown. You can see the communities grow and learn more about coffee farming on our blog.
